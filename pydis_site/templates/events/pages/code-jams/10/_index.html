    <p>Once a year we host a code jam for members of our server to participate in. The code jam is an event where we place you
        in a team with 5 other random server members. You then have 11 days to code some sort of application or program in Python.
        Your program must use the specified technology/framework and incorporate the theme chosen by the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the 11 days are complete, your team has 4 days to finish documentation and create a video presentation showcasing
        and walking through the program that your team has created. More details and specifics of this will be released within the next 2 weeks.
    </p>
