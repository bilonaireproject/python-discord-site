    <p>Twice a year we host a code jam for members of our server to participate in. The code jam is an event where we place you
        in a team with 5 other random server members. You then have 8 days to code some sort of application or program in Python.
        Your program must use the specified technology/framework and incorporate the theme chosen by the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the 8 days is complete, your team has 3 days to finish documentation and create a video presentation showcasing
        and walking through the program that your team has created.
    </p>

    <p>
        The chosen technology/tech stack for this year is <strong>Text User Interfaces</strong> (TUIs).
        Each team must create a program with one of <a href="{% url "events:page" path="code-jams/8/frameworks" %}">the approved frameworks</a> that creates a user interface that is text based.
        For more information of TUIs and what's involved with such an interface, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface">this wikipedia article</a>.

    <h3 if="qualifier"><a href="#qualifier">The Qualifier</a></h3>
    <p>
        The qualifier is a coding challenge that you are required to complete before registering for the code jam.
        This is meant as a basic assessment of your skills to ensure you have enough python knowledge to effectively contribute in a team environment.
