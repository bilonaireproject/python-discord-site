description: Google Collab is a high-powered custom version of Jupyter Notebook which supports e.g.
  !apt-get to install arbitrary Debian packages to the runtime, which is very generous with CPU and memory,
  and well-integrated with Google Drive.
  You can share your Collab Notebooks with other people and work collaboratively.
