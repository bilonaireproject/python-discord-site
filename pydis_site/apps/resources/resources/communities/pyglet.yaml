description: Pyglet is a powerful,
  yet easy to use Python library for developing games and other visually-rich applications on Windows,
  Mac OS X and Linux. It supports windowing, user interface event handling, Joysticks, OpenGL graphics,
  loading images and videos, and playing sounds and music. All of this with a friendly Pythonic API,
  that's simple to learn and doesn't get in your way.
