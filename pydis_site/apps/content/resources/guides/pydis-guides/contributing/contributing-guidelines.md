Thank you for your interest in our projects!

If you are interested in contributing, **this page contains the golden rules to follow when contributing.**
Supplemental information [can be found here](./supplemental-information/).
Do note that failing to comply with our guidelines may lead to a rejection of the contribution.

If you are confused by any of these rules, feel free to ask us in the `#dev-contrib` channel in our [Discord server.](https://discord.gg/python)

# The Golden Rules of Contributing

1. **Lint before you push.** We have simple but strict style rules that are enforced through linting.
You must always lint your code before committing or pushing.
[Using tools](./supplemental-information/#linting-and-pre-commit) such as `flake8` and `pre-commit` can make this easier.
Make sure to follow our [style guide](../style-guide/) when contributing.
2. **Make great commits.**
Great commits should be atomic, with a commit message explaining what and why.
More on that can be found in [this section](./supplemental-information/#writing-good-commit-messages).
3. **Do not open a pull request if you aren't assigned to the issue.**
If someone is already working on it, consider offering to collaborate with that person.
4. **Use assets licensed for public use.**
Whenever the assets are images, audio or even code, they must have a license compatible with our projects.
5. **Follow the [Python Discord Code of Conduct](https://pydis.com/coc).**
We aim to foster a welcoming and friendly environment on our open source projects.
We take violations of our Code of Conduct very seriously, and may respond with moderator action.

Welcome to our projects!
