Working with git can be daunting, but it is a powerful tool for collaboration and version control.
Below are links to regular workflows for working with Git using PyCharm or the CLI.

> **What's the difference?**<br>
> The integrated Git tool built into PyCharm offers a more visual and abstract way to use Git to manage your files.<br>
> However, the CLI offers more minute control and functionality compared to the GUI, which may not always do exactly what you want.
