                    Every channel on the server has a use, and we expect users to keep things relevant to the channel
                    whenever possible. Below, we've outlined all of the channels a normal user has access to send
                    messages to, and what they should be used for.

                <p>
                    Channels in this section are strictly on-topic, and designated for asking general Python-related
                    questions. If you're a beginner or you need some help with your Python, this is probably where you
                    want to be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please try to pick a channel that isn't busy when asking your question. If you're not sure
                    how best to ask a question, take a look at
                    <a href="{{ url_for("main.info.help") }}">our guide on that subject</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>Topical Chat/Help</h2>

                <p>
                    Channels in this section are strictly on-topic, and geared towards specific subjects. They can be
                    used for either discussion or asking questions - if you need help with one of the specific things
                    covered here, it's best to ask your question in the relevant channel rather than one of the general
                    help channels.
