                    Every channel on the server has a use, and we expect users to keep things relevant to the channel
                    whenever possible. Below, we've outlined all of the channels a normal user has access to send
                    messages to, and what they should be used for.
                </p>

                    requests in most cases. All channels in this category are on-topic.

                <p>
                    Channels in this section are designated for off-topic <strong>discussion</strong>, and any topic
                    may be talked about here once it follows our rules. Note that these channels are for discussion,
                    and are not places for you to dump images or memes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These channels are renamed daily by the server bot. Suggest funny channel names

                <h2>Python Help</h2>

                <p>
                    Channels in this section are strictly on-topic, and designated for asking general Python-related
                    questions. If you're a beginner or you need some help with your Python, this is probably where you
                    want to be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please try to pick a channel that isn't busy when asking your question. If you're not sure
                    how best to ask a question, take a look at
                    <a href="{{ url_for("main.info.help") }}">our guide on that subject</a>.

                <h2>Topical Chat/Help</h2>

                <p>
                    Channels in this section are strictly on-topic, and geared towards specific subjects. They can be
                    used for either discussion or asking questions - if you need help with one of the specific things
                    covered here, it's best to ask your question in the relevant channel rather than one of the general
                    help channels.

                                that this is not a discussion channel, and we do not allow postings for communities
                                or commercial projects - and if possible, we prefer that you post a link to your
                                source code instead of a website

                <p>
                    This section contains all of our general voice channels, as well as a single text channel -
                    <span class="fira-code">#voice-chat</span>. If you're in a voice channel but can't use a
                    microphone, you should use this channel to reply to other users using text instead of any
                    of the other channels.
