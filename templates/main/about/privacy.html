                    bunch of legal mumbo-jumbo, we've provided this information in an easy, human-readable form below.

                    We use your data for the daily maintainance of the server and website. In short: We only collect
                    what we need. To explain this in more detail:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Your Discord account details are useful for statistics - However, the storage of your assigned
                        roles in our database also allows our site to use a Discord account-based authorization system.
                        That means that all we have to do is assign the correct roles to you on Discord to give you
                        access to the relevant parts of the site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While we currently do not use your email address for anything, we do have projects in the works
                        that will make use of it. Don't worry, your email address will never leave our network, and we
                        won't send anything to you without your consent!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your messages are not stored in our database - they're stored temporarily in memory during
                        processing, and may also be written to a logfile.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We are a completely non-profit community. We have no interest in selling your data, or
                        shipping it off to third parties. Our community is entirely volunteer-run and it does not have
                        any form of monetary income whatsoever - and we believe that this is how it should be.

                    The data we collect is required for the daily operation of this website, our bot and the Discord
                    server. That said, we intend to fully comply with GDPR. Here's how we do this, and how you can
                    contact us with any questions you have:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When you join the server, we require that you accept our rules and terms by running a command
                        in the <code>#checkpoint</code> channel. In doing so, you agree that you will abide by our rules -
                        and you also agree to our data collection and usage policies (as detailed above).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Should you change your mind at any point, we cannot selectively remove data and keep your
                        membership on the server. If you'd like us to remove your data, there's only one thing you need
                        to do: Leave the Discord server. In doing that, all of your data will automatically be removed
                        from our systems. It's that simple!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you'd like a copy of the data we have belonging to you or you have any other questions about
                        our data and GDPR handling, feel free to send a message to our GDPR officer on Discord,
                        <code>gdude#2002</code> - or any other admin if he's not around.
