                    <p>
                        Every three months or so, we aim to host a server-wide code jam, suitable for all members of the server. In
                        these, we announce a theme and date in advance, and users may sign up via a link provided in the
                        announcements channel on the server. Once the sign-up period is over, users are grouped into
                        teams. On the day of the code jam, we announce a task - each team will then work on a solution
                        to this task.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the code jam is over, our staff team will review and test each submission. Once that's done,
                        a winner will be decided!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you'd like to join one of our code jams, feel free to ask a member of staff about the next one.

            <p>
                In order to keep things fair and on-topic, the following rules must be adhered to. Failure to
                follow these rules will result in disqualification.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Projects must be strongly Python-oriented.

                    <ul>
                        <li>You may mix in other languages, but the project must be Python-based.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You may not write any code in advance.</li>
                <li>You may not write any code after the deadline.</li>
                <li>The work must be your own - don't copy another team's work.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Additionally, the following suggestions could be helpful for all teams.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>All team members should contribute to the project in some way. Work together!</li>
                <li>Open your pull request early - that way, you know it'll be there by the deadline.</li>
                <li>Lint your code - we lint each pull request using Flake8, and your code should validate.</li>
                <li>Communicate with your teammates - Add them as a friend, start a group DM, and work together on the problem.</li>
            </ul>
