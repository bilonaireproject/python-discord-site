class DBMixin:
    """
    Mixin for classes that make use of RethinkDB. It can automatically create a table with the specified primary
    key using the attributes set at class-level.

    This class is intended to be mixed in alongside one of the other view classes. For example:

    >>> class MyView(APIView, DBMixin):
    ...     name = "my_view"  # Flask internal name for this route
    ...     path = "/my_view"  # Actual URL path to reach this route
    ...     table_name = "my_table"  # Name of the table to create
    ...     table_primary_key = "username"  # Primary key to set for this table

    This class will also work with Websockets:

    >>> class MyWebsocket(WS, DBMixin):
    ...     name = "my_websocket"
    ...     path = "/my_websocket"
    ...     table_name = "my_table"
    ...     table_primary_key = "username"

    You may omit `table_primary_key` and it will be defaulted to RethinkDB's default column - "id".
