    Base class for representing a Websocket.

    At minimum, you must implement the `on_message(self, message)` function. Without it, you won't be able to handle
    any messages, and an error will be thrown!

    If you need access to the database, you can mix-in DBMixin, just like any view class:

    >>> class DBWebsocket(WS, DBMixin):
    ...     name = "db_websocket"
    ...     path = "/db_websocket"  # This will be prefixed with "/ws" by the blueprint

    ...         self.send(
    ...             json.loads(self.db.get(self.table_name, message))
    ...         )

    Please note that an instance of this class is created for every websocket connected to the path. This does, however,
    mean that you can store any state required by your websocket.
